# Common commands in MongoDB
There are many commands in MongoDB. If you can't remember the commands you can type ``help`` in Mongo Shell.
Then it will show you the commands and the simple description. Here I list some common commands. Want to know
the detail of commands you can check the manual [here](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/) or use ``help`` command.

**Common commands**
```
show dbs            show database names
show collections    show collections in vurrent database
db.version()        show current version of the server
